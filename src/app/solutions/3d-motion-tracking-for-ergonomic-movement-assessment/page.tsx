            Our cloud-based platform is designed to seamlessly collect, manage,
            and visualize kinetic and kinematic data sourced from wearable
            sensors. With a primary focus on offering a comprehensive ergonomic
            movement assessment, our goal is to enhance workplace efficiency by
            providing valuable insights into the dynamics of human movement.

                The platform conducts ergonomic evaluations based on widely
                recognized standards such as OWAS and relevant ISO norms,
                ensuring a robust and reliable analysis. Leveraging AI-based
                software, we achieve valid and trustworthy movement data,
                enabling the simultaneous ergonomic assessment of 5-10 workers.

                Moreover, our platform incorporates Machine Learning-based
                analytics to provide insightful forecasts for workplace and
                process redesign. By combining real-time data, AI-driven
                assessments, and predictive analytics, we empower businesses to
                proactively optimize their environments for improved
                productivity and employee well-being.

                Developed in collaboration with our trusted partner DFKI within
                the framework of BIONIC, funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
                2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The
                project aimed to develop an unobtrusive, autonomous, and
                privacy-preserving platform for real-time risk alerting and
                continuous persuasive coaching, enabling the design of workplace
                interventions adapted to the needs and fitness levels of
                specific aging workforce.

                Gamification strategies adapted to the needs and wishes of the
                elderly workers ensure optimal engagement for prevention and
                self-management of musculoskeletal health in any working/living
                environment.
